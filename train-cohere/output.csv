For each character in the string s, both the one-digit and two-digit representations are considered. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), dp[i] is incremented by dp[i-1], representing an additional way to decode the string using the one-digit representation. Similarly, if the two-digit representation is valid (>=10 and <=26), dp[i] is incremented by dp[i-2], indicating a way to decode the string using the two-digit representation.
