"The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.", "true"
"The algorithm uses a sliding window with two pointers, left and right, to iterate through the string. It also uses a set to store the unique characters in the current window.1. Initialize left and right pointers to the start of the string, and maxLength to 0.2. Check if the character at the right index is in the set.   - If it's not in the set, add the character to the set, update maxLength, and move the right pointer forward.   - If it's in the set, remove the character at the left index from the set, and move the left pointer forward.3. Repeat step 2 until the right pointer reaches the end of the string.4. Return maxLength. The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.", "false"
"1. Choose the smaller array as nums1 so that the problem is simpler with less log(n) complexity.2. Use Binary Search (BS) to partition the smallest array.3. Now we calculate the position of partition in the larger array (nums2) having fetched the smaller one.4. Find the four important numbers - maxSize - left and right of partition in the two arrays.5. If maxSizeLeft <= minSizeRight and maxSizeLeft2 <= minSizeRight2, then the partition of both arrays is correct, if not, adjust the partition of nums1. If maxLeftX > minRightY, move the BS partition to the left; if maxLeftY > minRightX, move the BS partition to the right.6. When the correct partition is found, calculate the median based on the length of the merged array, even or odd.", "false"
"1. Initialize `start` and `maxLength` for result substring.2. Iterate through the given string `s` using the index `i`.3. For each index `i`, create two pointers `l` and `r` starting at `i`.4. Check if there's a consecutive sequence of identical characters, increment the right pointer `r` until the end of the sequence is reached.5. Update the index `i` to the current value of `r`.6. Expand the pointers `l` and `r` outwards to find the longest palindromic substring, checking that characters on both sides are equal.7. If the current length of the substring is greater than `maxLength`, update `start` and `maxLength`.8. Return the longest palindromic substring using the `start` and `maxLength`.", "false"
"The algorithm initializes `res` as 0. Then, we determine the sign of the input integer and take its absolute value. We use a while loop to iterate through each digit of `x` from right to left. In each iteration, we multiply the current `res` by 10 and add the last digit of `x` to it. The last digit of `x` is obtained by `x % 10`. After adding the last digit, we remove it from `x` by doing either `x /= 10` or `x //= 10`.After processing all the digits, we adjust `res` with the sign we computed earlier. Finally, we check if the reversed integer is within the 32-bit integer range. If it is, we return the result; otherwise, we return 0.", "false"
"The algorithm uses a stack data structure to check the validity of the input string. It iterates through the string one character at a time. When an open bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a close bracket is encountered, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty or the corresponding open bracket is not at the top of the stack. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. If not, the open bracket is popped from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, the function returns false, indicating there were unmatched open braces. Otherwise, the function returns true, indicating that the string is valid.", "false"
"The algorithm first sorts the intervals based on their start time. Then, it initializes an empty list `result` to store the merged intervals, and adds the first interval to `result`. Next, it iterates through the remaining intervals, comparing the end time of the last interval in `result` to the start time of the current interval. If they overlap (i.e., the end time of the last interval in `result` is greater than or equal to the start time of the current interval), then the end time of the last interval in `result` is updated to the maximum of its own end time and the end time of the current interval. Otherwise, the current interval is added to `result`. The process continues until all intervals have been processed, and `result` contains the merged, non-overlapping intervals covering the input intervals.", "false"
"For each of the implementation above, we use a Depth-First Search (DFS) based algorithm to traverse the grid board. The DFS function takes the current cell index i and j and the index of the character in the input word that we are looking for (k).The base cases are:- If the cell indexes i or j are out of boundaries, or the board[i][j] character does not match word[k], return false.- If k (current character index) is equal to word.length - 1, we find the word in the grid, so return true.For each cell, we run the DFS function with the given input parameters. If DFS returns true (found the word), the whole function will return true.", "false"
"We use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem. The `dp` array is of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is always one way to decode an empty string.For each character in the string `s`, consider its corresponding one-digit and two-digits representations. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-1]`, which means one more way to decode the string by using the one-digit representation of the current character. If the two-digits representation is valid (>=10 and <=26), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-2]`, meaning one way to decode the string by using the two-digits representation of the current character.After we finished iterating through the string `s`, `dp[n]` will store the number of ways to decode the entire string.", "false"
"The algorithm is based on Depth First Search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree.1. Create a helper function that takes the root and maximum path sum reference as the input parameters.2. If the current node (root) is null, return 0.3. Call the helper function recursively for the left and right child nodes:   - Set `left` as the maximum of 0 and the helper function call for the left child.   - Set `right` as the maximum of 0 and the helper function call for the right child.4. Update the maximum path sum using the current maximum, the sum of the current node's value, and the left and right children's values.5. Return the sum of the current node's value and the maximum of the left and right subtrees.Call the helper function with the given binary tree root and return the maximum path sum.", "false"
"The algorithm uses the topological sorting approach utilizing Kahn's Algorithm to solve this problem. We maintain an adjacency list to represent the graph and a list of in-degrees for each vertex (course) Mark the vertices with in-degree 0 and add them to a queue (these are starter courses). Then, we process each node (course) in the queue, decrease in-degrees of their neighbors (courses they unlock). If the in-degree of any neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue. In the end, if we have processed all courses, return true; otherwise, return false if any course is not processed.", "false"
